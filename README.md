## About Top Video Game Dashboard

`Video Game Dashboard` is a team-created Flask-Pymongo-MongoDB web dashboard that provides a live snapshot about the top 5 Steam video game titles. This dashboard reports on the following five metrics and sources:

    - Revenue (Statista)
    - Viewership / Subscribership (Twitch)
    - Playerbase (SteamCharts)
    - Search Relevance (Google Trends)
    - Correlation to parallel blockchain games (DappRadar)

Data generation done via web scrapping and direct import into a mongoDB database, and a Flask web server app will be calling and graphing the data when a user interacts with our dashboard. Our aim is to provide a general overview of the performance of trending video games and the video game industry as a whole. 

Along with the analysis, project also involved a written report and a Powerpoint presentation.
